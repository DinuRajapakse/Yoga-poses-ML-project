# Yoga poses ML project
 
Please note that this project is still in progress.

In this project I am attempting to classify 5000+ images of different yoga poses to its proper class out of 107 classes. I have decided to use CNNs to achieve this target. Since I am working with RGB images, I require more computation power than I currently have access to in order to train and tune the model.
